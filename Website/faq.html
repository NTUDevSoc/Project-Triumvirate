                <strong>What is this event about?</strong>
                <p class = "lead">All of DevSoc's socials have been compromised. Fortunately, DevSoc have been able to regain access to most of their socials. The only thing left is the website but these hackers have changed the password and DevSoc needs your help to get it back! For this challenge you need to use some CTF, cryptography and intelligence gathering tactics. </p>
                <br>
                <strong>How do I participate?</strong>
                <p class = "lead">To participate in this event you need to be an NTU student with a T/N number. You then need to decide how big you'd like your team to be (1 - 3 people). Once you've got that part handled you should start looking for clues on the DevSoc socials left behind by the hackers and use them to move forward in the challenge. The password has been split into 3 parts and you must acquire all 3 sections first before combining them and submitting the final flag via the google forms link.</p>
                <br>
                <strong>What is the duration of the event?</strong>
                <p class = "lead">The event starts on 28th September at 10:00am. You will have till 23:59pm on the 9th of October to submit the flag before submissions are closed.</p>
                <br>
                <strong>What do I win?</strong>
                <p class = "lead">Our event is sponsored by HackTheBox so the first 3 teams to submit the correct flag will receive a VIP subscription for the platform. Specific prize details are outlined down below in our terms and conditions.</p>
                <br>
                <strong>How big can my team be?</strong>
                <p class = "lead">Teams can be a minimum size of 1 person and a maximum size of 3 people. Feel free to work alone or pair up wih a couple of friends to solve this challenge!</p>
                <br>
                <strong>How do I submit the flag?</strong>
                <p class = "lead">You submit the flag via the google forms link available on all of our socials and on this website under the submit button in the top right corner of the webpage. Only <strong>one team member</strong> needs to make the flag submission for the whole group. Please try to avoid repeatedly submitting flags if possible. Go over your flag with your team mates before hitting the submit button.</p>
