# Project Triumvirate
**Project Triumvirate** was a Capture the Flag (CTF) event that ran during Nottingham Trent University's "Welcome Week 2020". Participants had two weeks (28th September - 9th October 2020) to follow the trail of clues to retrieve the password flag to the DevSoc website. This CTF involved elements of cryptography and open source intelligence gathering (OSINT).  

The event was sponsored by [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite) and the prizes are outlined in the event's [Terms & Conditions](https://github.com/NTUDevSoc/Project-Triumvirate/blob/main/Event%20Terms%20and%20Conditions.docx).

#### The Backstory:
"The idea for this event came about after I spent lockdown self-teaching myself more about cybersecurity and it's related topic areas. I wanted to share some of the cool things I had learnt in those few months with everyone in a way that got our whole community working together ... and so Project Triumvirate was born.  

An event designed so that even non-tech-savvy folks could get involved and flex their 'googling'/research capabilities. After the success of the first iteration, I'm hoping we'll get to revisit the posibility of making CTFs for DevSoc again." - **Hannah**
