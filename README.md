# Project Triumvirate
**Project Triumvirate** was a Capture the Flag (CTF) event that ran during Nottingham Trent University's "Welcome Week 2020".  
Participants had two weeks (28th September - 9th October 2020) to follow the trail of clues to retrieve the password flag to the DevSoc website. This CTF involved elements of cryptography and open source intelligence gathering (OSINT).  

The event was sponsored by [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite) and the prizes are outlined in the event's [Terms & Conditions](https://github.com/NTUDevSoc/Project-Triumvirate/blob/main/Event%20Terms%20and%20Conditions.docx).
