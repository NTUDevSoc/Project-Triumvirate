Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you!
Sometimes, later becomes never. DO IT NOW.
JUST DO IT. JUST. DO. IT. 
It's going to be hard, but hard does not mean impossible.
Don't wait for an opportunity. Create it.
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.
Dwell in possibility.
Some friendships are so strong, they can transcend lifetimes.
